Hi there! ![wave](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d04509037f646eab5c2d6d130574ef059fa8eef92e45a139a827a8d06e9d5042/68747470733a2f2f656d6f6a69732e736c61636b6d6f6a69732e636f6d2f656d6f6a69732f696d616765732f313533363335313037352f343539342f626c6f622d776176652e676966)
I'm [Israel](https://linkedin.com/in/israel-akintunde), a product and design engineer based in Nigeria.
I build interfaces and experiences that don't just look pretty, but actually work.
Outside of code, I'm either in the gym or watching anime (One Piece is my favorite).
