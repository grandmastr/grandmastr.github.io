I'm [Israel](https://linkedin.com/in/israel-akintunde), a product and design engineer based in Nigeria.

I build interfaces and experiences that don't just look pretty, but actually workâ€”fully functional at 60fps and accessible to everyone.

Outside of code, I'm either in the gym or watching anime (One Piece is my favorite).
